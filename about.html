            This website was created in 2021 by me, 
            <a class="link_within" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mhea-bustria/">Mhea</a>
            to help figure out the new ending for a verb based on the subject pronoun.
            <br><br>The inspiration for this website was to help my sister practice going through steps to conjugate verbs. I noticed that during her Spanish homework, my sister had a tough time while trying to use hand-drawn charts on pieces of paper to figure out what ending she should use for a word... it also seemed hard to figure out WHY this process was being done.
            <br><br>So, I wanted to try making the process more simple, step-by-step, fun, and interactive. As a person who is passionate about helping people learn (and have fun while learning), I chose to add fun images to enhance visual learning, repetition, and positive feedback.

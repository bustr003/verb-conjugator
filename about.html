            I created this website to help Spanish-learners figure out the new ending of a verb based on what the subject of the sentence is.
            <br><br>I was inspired to make this website because I wanted to help my sister practice the process of conjugating verbs. I noticed that during her Spanish homework, my sister had a tough time trying to interpret pre-made charts on paper to figure out what ending she should use for a word. . . it also seemed hard for her to realize <i>why</i> this process was being done.
            <br><br>As a person who is passionate about helping people learn, I wanted to make the process more simple, step-by-step, interactive, and fun.
            <br><br>I made sure to consider my sister's favorite colors when choosing the color palette for this website, and I also wanted to make sure that there is never too much information on the page at one time.  I also chose to add fun images to enhance visual feedback and repetition.
        </p>

            <br>I hope you enjoy this website!

# verb-conjugator

## Overview
Conjugate Spanish verbs in the present tense through the following steps:
- First, the website asks the user if the verb is an **-ar, -er, or -ir verb**.
- Second, the website asks if the user is addressing only **one person or multiple people**.
- Third, the website asks for the **subject pronoun** that the user wants to use.
- Fourth, the website tells the user what **ending** would replace the "ar", "er", or "ir" part of the verb. The website reminds the user that they need to place the **root** of the word before the new ending.
These steps are listed in the "help" page of the website.
